This is the Octopress source of my blog at [http://browniefed.com](http://browniefed.com).
If you're reading this there are likely unfinished, unpublished, and in process blog posts. Have at it.

Also Octopress is meh (it works), I wish I wasn't depending on Ruby stuff. Use something else non-jekyll based, your life will be much easier.
