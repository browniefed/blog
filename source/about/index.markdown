<p>
My name is Jason Brown, I'm a front end developer passionate about building things with the latest and greatest technologies. At the moment that's currently React. Also I'm currently exploring React Native and delving into the world of mobile development. If you are looking for someone to build something or to ask any questions you can shoot me an email me at <a href="mailto:browniefed@gmail.com">browniefed@gmail.com</a> or tweet at me <a href="http://twitter.com/browniefed">@browniefed</a>.
