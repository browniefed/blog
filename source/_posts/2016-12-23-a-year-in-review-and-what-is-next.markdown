## Absence

I made a decision to not post as much on this blog over the past year. Despite reaching upwards of 300,000 views in the past 1.5 years, I wasn't seeing the positive feedback I was hoping for. Not compliments, but increase knowledge around animations, and just a general positive impact on the community.

I now realize I was wrong. Over the course of the year many people have been posting new animated blog tutorials.
I won't go through my entire twitter timeline but one recently was from someone who posted an animation tutorial.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/browniefed">@browniefed</a> Thanks for you feedback. I appreciate it. Big fan of your blog btw. I&#39;ve learned a lot reading your posts!</p>&mdash; Rational App Dev (@rationalappdev) <a href="https://twitter.com/rationalappdev/status/812361076113219584">December 23, 2016</a></blockquote>

Lurking in chat channels, many have been helping others with animations and referencing my blog as where they learned.
It's a good feeling. This year I will return to the blog.

## Making Money

This blog has made me $0 directly (except a $20 bitcoin gift, thanks Daniel). Indirectly it has been invaluable for being a resource where people learn my name, and attach it to things they'ved learned. Things that have helped them wow their coworkers, make an interaction a touch better, or just learn something that helps them ship that next feature.

I don't believe donations are sustainable. 
Every resource that is valuable and sustainable are all charging money like [React Training](https://reacttraining.com/), or anything from [Wes Bos](https://reactforbeginners.com/), and anyone else that is selling courses like [educative.io](https://www.educative.io/).

I enjoy helping people but 75% of what I build/write/etc from now on will cost money ( or earn me money in some way).

## What Have I Been Doing

Living my life I suppose. One thing I've been doing is consuming way too much.
Consuming others knowledge is fun and valuable but I personally have not be investing.

I'm trying to fix this. I'm trying to consume less but that's a work in progress.

Since I've been trying to focus on creationg I've done some Egghead work. It's been great and Egghead is fantastic!

You can check out my first course [Animate React Native UI Elements](https://egghead.io/courses/animate-react-native-ui-elements)    
You can check out all my lessons here [Instructor - Jason Brown](https://egghead.io/instructors/jason-brown-20a6bf03-254a-428c-9984-dca76cc84f32)

More courses and lessons are on the way. 1 course is completed, and the other is in production.

## A Year to Reboot

It'll be a good year to reboot, and I'm definitely not waiting till the new year starts to take action.

My plans will include.

* **Heavier time investment in open source**    
-- I contribute where I want but I'd like a few open source projects to maintain.

* **Dumping knowledge into more outlets**     
-- Including more egghead, blog posts, my own knowledge base sites, interactive tutorials

* **Consume less, Create more**     
-- Catching up on the latest things at night, not the instant it happens

* **Better time management**      
-- Not much needs to be said here, but maintaining a healthy life style along w/ accomplishing all of this will be difficult

* **Say No more often**     
-- This plays into time management, but saying no to things I know I don't really want to do will be crucial

* **New Technologies**    
-- I've been very focused on JS land. It's fun but I need to expand my breadth of knowledge. Basically be a better T-Shaped person.


## Anyway

It's been a good year for me personally. Excited for 2017. Looking forward to whatever the hell happens.
