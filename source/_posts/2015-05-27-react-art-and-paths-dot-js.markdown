### Intro

[Paths.js](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-js) is a cool library. It comes with 3 levels of generating paths. 

* Low level which helps you generate paths/lines.
* Mid level which generates paths for shapes
* High level which takes a set of data and generates graphs

All of these are great when working with `react-art` because it's just returning data. I'll say it once, and a million more but libraries that just generate data make it easy to traverse and render with `react-art`.

### Simple Shapes


### Graphs



### Conclusion

Combined with some tweening you could make some very effective graphs that animate. That is a topic for another time.
