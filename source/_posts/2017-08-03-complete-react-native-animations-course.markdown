React Native has increased in popularity over the past year. It's growth will only sky rocket as more companies like AirBnB, Uber, Facebook, and even smaller agencies learn to leverage it. 

One missing piece that I've attempted to document for the past 2 years is animations. I started when I didn't know animations at all, and have grown to be able to breakdown and reconstruct them using the powers of Animated and React.

In my course we will walk through basic animations, understanding interpolation, and move onto real world examples like shared element photo grid transitions. I've condensed all the knowledge I have about animations down into this course. Including animation breakdowns and explaining my mental model for how I build out UI before animating.

If you have learned anything from the free content I've put out and want to support me, or are just getting started then come master React Native animations with my course.
