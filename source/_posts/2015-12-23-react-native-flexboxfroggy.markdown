If you are in the React Native world and haven't heard about [Exponent](https://exponentjs.com/) then you've been living under a rock. It's being built by James Ide, Brent Vatne, and Charlie Cheever. All who have contributed significantly to the React Native community and ecosystem.

Brent is holding a contest to win some awesome prizes, including tickets to the sold out ReactJS 2016 Conf. Check out the contest here [https://gist.github.com/brentvatne/7d88f846417452355b18](https://gist.github.com/brentvatne/7d88f846417452355b18).

What does this have to do with flexbox? Well as my entry into the contest I converted [http://flexboxfroggy.com/](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) to React Native.

Even adding animations was a breeze! One line of code `LayoutAnimation.spring()` easily makes all frogs spring into place!

You can check out the code here [https://github.com/browniefed/flexboxfroggy](https://github.com/browniefed/flexboxfroggy)

Or if you have Exponent installed you can run it easily on your phone by just tapping this link [http://exp.host/@browniefed/flexboxfroggy](http://exp.host/@browniefed/flexboxfroggy)

If you don't have Exponent installed I highly suggest you install it!

That's all from me for now. Looking forward to getting back to blogging in 2016!
