So I wrote a book of sorts on React Native animations. Mostly covering the animated API, and soon much much more. Check it out here [http://browniefed.com/react-native-animation-book/](http://browniefed.com/react-native-animation-book/).

I cover the API, and walk through basic animation examples, and soon advanced topics. Learn to create a fun dragging, spinning square.

This is just a quick update :)
