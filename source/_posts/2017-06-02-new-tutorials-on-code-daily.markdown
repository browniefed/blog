I've officially launched my new site [Code Daily](codedaily.io). This site will now house all of my tutorials, screencasts, and courses.

The goal is to post some bit of content on a daily basis. Anything from a tutorial, to a screencast, or even full courses could be published daily!

These will primarily be focused on React, React Native, and general web development practices. However as I slowly grow and see where the web/mobile is headed I will devote more time towards that content.

I will do my best to provide value and making the "bleeding edge" of web/mobile technologies less intimidating.

I will still update some content on this site, but at some point redirects will be setup to my new site. 

So if you still want to get content visit [Code Daily](codedaily.io), and follow me on twitter at [https://twitter.com/codedailyio](https://twitter.com/codedailyio).
